# Rust Fundamentals Exercises (100 Algorithmic Challenges)

This repository serves as a personal portfolio to document my learning journey of the Rust programming language, focusing on core programming logic and system safety concepts.

The solutions are based on Prof. Gustavo Guanabara's 100 Algorithmic Challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Structure

The project is organized sequentially to reflect the learning progression:

* **Basic\_exercises**: Core sequence of operations (I/O, basic math, type parsing).
* **basic conditionals**: Projects demonstrating conditional logic (`if/else`).
* **Challenges**: Projects requiring complex logic, loops, and time calculation (like Ex. 16 - Smoker's Lifespan).

## üöÄ Key Rust Skills Demonstrated

By reviewing the solutions, you can observe mastery in:

* **Memory Safety & Ownership:** Correct handling of `String` vs `&str` and mutability (`mut`).
* **Error Handling:** Robust use of `.trim().parse()` and `.expect()` for safe user input validation.
* **Control Flow:** Mastery of `while`, `for` loops, conditional logic (`if/else`), and pattern matching (`match`).
* **Data Structures:** Implementation and manipulation of dynamic arrays (`Vec<T>`).

*This repository is actively maintained and solutions are provided using idiomatic Rust where appropriate.*
